Read .md files if you need information for any implementation.
Refractor if exceeding 500 lines.
Make it responsive.
Do the absolute minimal code change for the request to prevent breaking other features/codes.
Any confirmation/popup dialog should be Flowbite.
Make the code modular and with proper comments so that a human can edit it later.
Do not change any other methods or anything in the files I sent unless it's absolutely necessary for what I ask for to work. 
Do not fix style in the existing code unless I ask for that. . 
Do not remove existing comments unless I explicitly ask for it or we're removing that code completely.
Always use Flowbite "small" theme.
Use free Font Awesome icons
Any new component should strictly follow Flowbite.
