## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built App (Recommended)

Download the latest DMG from the releases:
```
Slides Indexer_0.4.3_aarch64.dmg
```

Install and run the app. The index is stored at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/com.example.slidesindexer/slides-indexer/index.json
```

**Note**: This is a **Tauri-only desktop application** (not a web app). All troubleshooting and debugging should be done via the Tauri app, not a browser.

### Option 2: Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ (for building frontend)
- Rust/Cargo (for building Tauri backend)
- macOS for building .app/.dmg (cross-platform support planned)

**For full PDF OCR support, install external tools:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install poppler tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr

# Windows
# Download from official websites or use chocolatey
```

**Build steps:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the Tauri app and DMG
npm run tauri:build
```

The built app will be at:
```
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Slides Indexer.app
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Slides Indexer_0.4.3_aarch64.dmg
```

**Debug build** (includes DevTools and verbose logging):
```
src-tauri/target/debug/bundle/macos/Slides Indexer.app
src-tauri/target/debug/bundle/dmg/Slides Indexer_0.4.3_aarch64.dmg
```

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload and console output
npm run tauri:dev
```

This starts Vite dev server and launches the Tauri app window with console logging enabled.

**Important for Tauri Development:**
- DevTools are available in debug builds (press `Cmd+Option+I` in dev mode)
- All `println!` statements from Rust appear in the Terminal
- Frontend logs (`console.log`) appear in DevTools console
- For troubleshooting, always check Terminal output first

### Debug vs Release Builds

```bash
# Debug build (verbose logging, DevTools enabled)
npm run tauri build -- --debug

# Release build (optimized, smaller size)
npm run tauri build
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Link Folders**: Click "Link folder" to add directories containing your documents
2. **Manual Indexing**: Click "Rescan" button to scan and index all PowerPoint and PDF files
3. **Search**: Use the search bar to find documents by content, keywords, or phrases
4. **Preview**: Click any result to see page/slide previews with highlighted matches
5. **Open Files**: Click the file icon to open documents in their native applications

**Note**: Linking folders no longer triggers automatic scanning. Use the "Rescan" button when you're ready to index files.

### Advanced Features

#### Intelligent Caching
- **SHA-256 checksums** are automatically calculated for each indexed file
- **Unchanged files are skipped** during re-scans for dramatically faster performance
- **Scanned PDFs never re-run OCR** unless the file content actually changes
- **Incremental saving** - Cache saves after each file (v0.4.0+)
  - Safe to interrupt scans - already-indexed files are preserved
  - OCR work is never lost, even if app closes
  - Console shows: "üíæ Cache saved (items: X)" after each file
- Caching uses two-tier verification:
  1. **Quick check**: Modification time comparison (instant)
  2. **Full check**: Checksum calculation only if time changed
- Use "Clear Cache" button to force a complete re-index when needed
- Checksums are stored persistently across sessions

#### Viewing Cache Status (Console Logs)
To see which files are being cached vs. scanned, run the app from terminal:

```bash
# For installed app
/Applications/Slides\ Indexer.app/Contents/MacOS/Slides\ Indexer

# For dev mode
npm run tauri:dev
```

During scanning, you'll see console output:
- `‚úì Cached (quick): filename.pdf` - File loaded from cache via mod time check (instant)
- `‚úì Cached (checksum): filename.pdf` - File cached via checksum match (time changed, content same)
- `‚ü≥ Scanning: filename.pdf` - File being actively scanned
- `‚ü≥ Running OCR on PDF: filename.pdf` - OCR in progress (first time only)
- `üíæ Cache saved (items: 1083)` - Cache persisted to disk after each file (v0.4.0+)
- `üóëÔ∏è Removed from cache (deleted): filename.pdf` - Deleted file cleaned up

**First scan**: All files will show `‚ü≥ Scanning:` as checksums are calculated, cache saves after each
**Subsequent scans**: Unchanged files show `‚úì Cached (quick):` and process instantly

#### Search Capabilities
- **Exact Phrases**: Wrap text in quotes for exact phrase matching
- **Wildcards**: Use `*` for multiple characters, `?` for single characters
- **Real-time**: Results update instantly as you type
- **Keywords**: Automatically extracts and searches relevant keywords
- **Highlighted Matches**: Search terms are highlighted in yellow throughout preview text
- **Directory Filtering**: Checkbox controls to include/exclude specific folders from search

#### Directory Management
- **Selective Search**: Click checkboxes next to directories to filter search results
- **Select All/Deselect All**: Quick toggle button for bulk directory selection
- **Visual Indicators**: Badge shows how many folders are selected for search
- **Persistent Selection**: Directory preferences are maintained across searches

#### OCR Support
- Scanned PDFs are processed with OCR for text extraction
- Requires `poppler` and `tesseract` installation for full functionality
- Fallback text extraction works without external dependencies

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Files always showing as "Scanned" instead of "Cached":**
- **Symptom**: Rescan shows non-zero scan count even when no files changed
- **Cause**: Files with no extractable content (scanned PDFs, encrypted PDFs) 
- **Fixed in v0.1.9**: Checksums now properly cache files regardless of content
- **Debug**: Scan details panel in UI shows why files aren't being cached

**Files showing as "New File Detected" every time:**
- **Symptom**: Same files appear as new on every scan, OCR runs repeatedly
- **Cause (Pre-v0.4.0)**: Cache was only saved at END of scan - interrupted scans lost all progress
- **Fixed in v0.4.0**: Cache saves after EACH file is indexed
- **Solution**: Let complete scan finish, or check console for "üíæ Cache saved" confirmations
- **Check**: Look at `~/Library/Application Support/com.example.slidesindexer/slides-indexer/index.json`

**Large PDFs taking long to scan:**
- **First Scan**: OCR runs once per PDF (can take 5-30 seconds per file)
- **Subsequent Scans**: PDF should show "‚úì Cached" and skip OCR
- **If not caching**: Check scan details panel - shows checksum and mod time info
- **v0.4.0+**: OCR work is saved immediately, safe to interrupt

**OCR not working:**
- Install required dependencies: `brew install poppler tesseract`
- App will show warning if dependencies missing
- Basic text extraction works without OCR

**Debugging & Console Logs:**
This is a **Tauri desktop application** - all debug information appears in the Terminal/console, not in a browser console.

**To see detailed logs**, always run the app from Terminal:
```bash
# For installed app
/Applications/Slides\ Indexer.app/Contents/MacOS/Slides\ Indexer

# For development
npm run tauri:dev
```

**What you'll see in console:**
- Scan initialization and cache stats
- File-by-file progress with status icons
- Checksum calculations and cache decisions
- OCR operations and progress
- Cache save confirmations: "üíæ Cache saved (items: X)"
- Deleted file cleanup notifications

### Key Features Implementation

> **üìñ For detailed technical documentation on the caching mechanism, see [CACHING-NOTES.md](./CACHING-NOTES.md)**

#### Checksum-Based Caching
- **SHA-256 Calculation**: Uses `sha2` crate in Rust for fast, reliable hashing with 8KB streaming buffer
- **Storage**: Checksums stored in `SlideIndexItem` struct and persisted to JSON
- **Incremental Saving (v0.4.0)**: Cache saves after EACH file is indexed (not just at end)
  - **Critical for OCR**: Slow OCR scans are now crash-resistant
  - **No lost progress**: Already-indexed files are safe if scan interrupted
  - **Console shows**: "üíæ Cache saved (items: X)" after each file
  - **Solves**: Files requiring long OCR operations are now reliably cached
- **Two-Tier Caching Strategy (v0.3.0)**:
  1. **Quick check**: Compare modification time only (instant, no I/O)
  2. **Full check**: Calculate checksum only if mod time changed
  3. **Console output**: "‚úì Cached (quick)" vs "‚úì Cached (checksum)"
  4. **Performance**: 50-75x faster rescans for unchanged collections
- **Comparison Logic**:
  1. **Primary: Checksum comparison** - If both checksums exist and match ‚Üí always cache (even if no content)
  2. **Fallback: Modification time** - If checksum unavailable, compare mod time
  3. **Rationale**: Files with no extractable text (scanned PDFs, encrypted PDFs) shouldn't be re-scanned if unchanged
- **Important Fixes**:
  - **v0.1.9**: Files with empty content are now correctly cached when checksums match
  - **v0.4.0**: Incremental saving prevents lost progress on interrupted scans

#### Clear Cache Functionality
- **Tauri Command**: `clear_cache` exposed to frontend via IPC
- **Implementation**: Clears all cached items and forces fresh scan on next index
- **UI**: Red "Clear Cache" button in action bar
- **Persistence**: State changes written to JSON file immediately

#### OCR Integration
- **External Tools**: Calls `pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`, and `tesseract` from Rust
- **Dependency Detection**: Automatic detection of missing OCR tools
- **Fallback Chain**: 
  1. Try native PDF text extraction
  2. Try `pdftotext` if available
  3. Try OCR with `pdftoppm` + `tesseract` if available
- **Error Reporting**: Clear guidance for installing missing dependencies

### Building & Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run tauri:dev    # Hot reload with Vite + Tauri

# Production build
npm run tauri:build  # Build app and DMG

# Frontend only
npm run build        # Build frontend assets
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server (for UI testing)

# Type checking
npm run check        # Svelte + TypeScript validation
npm run lint         # Code linting (optional)
```

### Viewing Console Logs (Tauri App Only)

**This is a Tauri desktop application** - all Rust backend logs appear in Terminal, not in a browser console.

```bash
# Run installed app with console output
/Applications/Slides\ Indexer.app/Contents/MacOS/Slides\ Indexer

# Development mode (console output included automatically)
npm run tauri:dev

# Debug build (verbose logging)
./src-tauri/target/debug/bundle/macos/Slides\ Indexer.app/Contents/MacOS/Slides\ Indexer
```

**Console Output Includes:**
- `üìä Scan initialized: Existing cached items: 1082`
- `‚úì Cached (quick): presentation.pptx` - Instant cache via mod time
- `‚ü≥ Running OCR on PDF: scanned-doc.pdf` - OCR operations
- `üíæ Cache saved (items: 1083)` - Incremental saves after each file
- `üóëÔ∏è Removed from cache (deleted): old-file.pdf` - Cleanup operations
- `‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ Scan Summary ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ` - Final statistics

**Troubleshooting:**
- Always run from Terminal to see what's happening
- Look for error messages, cache confirmations, and OCR status
- DevTools (`Cmd+Option+I` in debug builds) only needed for frontend UI issues
