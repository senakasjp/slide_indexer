I have various Powerpoint and Beamer slidesets.
When I need I can't find relevent slides.
I need a software using svelt to keep an index of all slides.
When I give the path, software should scan all slides of slidesets and keep an index
Using a keyword, I should be able to find slidesets with its path. Need a preview as well.
Keep the data in a json based database.
